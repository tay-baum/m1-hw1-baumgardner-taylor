## About Me ##
My name is Taylor Baumgardner and I currently live in Naples, FL. I have a BA in Biblical studies and am currently in the last semester (yay!) of my MA in Global Strategic Communications and a Graduate Certificate in Web Design, which is why I am in this class. My professional career started in administration with an organization that needed a lot of things, one of which was someone to do graphic design. I picked up that hat because it interested me and it turned into much more than that! Since then I have worked in marketing for small business, done some freelance design work, and am currently an in-house art director for a local church.

## Past Coding Experience ##
I don't have any past coding experience beyond adjusting existing html code on hosted websites. I'm anticipating this course to be one of the more challenging ones that I've taken! I've always wanted to learn some coding, so I'm looking forward to it with a small amount of wariness and a lot of anticipation!

## Career Goals ##
1. Graduation
2. Position promotion within my current company
3. Build our team by adding another paid position and 2 intern positions
4. Develop our web and social presence over the next school year, focusing on engagment and clicks over followers
